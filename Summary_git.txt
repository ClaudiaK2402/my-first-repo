Git tracks chagnes to plain text files (code files and text documents).
A directory where changes to files are tracked by Git is called a Git repository.
You can track changes to a file using git add [name of file]
You can create a milestone about the state of your files using git commit -m "message".
To examine the state of files in your repository use git status.
