Git tracks chagnes to plain text files (code files and text documents).
A directory where changes to files are tracked by Git is called a Git repository.
You can track changes to a file using git add [name of file]
You can create a milestone about the state of your files using git commit -m "message".
To examine the state of files in your repository use git status.
Exercises to git
To reset the last commit: git reset --soft Head~

2. Lesson to git:
Use git diff file.txt to show the changes made since the last commit.
With git checkout file.txt last changes can be unmade.

3. .gitignore:
On each line in this file files or types of files can be specified which should not be tracked by git.

4. Branching
Using different branches more people can work on the same file without overwriting others.
Add new branch: git branch <branchname>
change to different branch: git checkout <branchname>
delete branch: git branch -d <branchname>
