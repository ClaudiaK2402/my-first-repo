#Simple rules for markdown files that end on .md

Pound signs (#, ##) make headings.
A word surrounded by single asterisks (*word*) makes that word italicized.
A word surrounded by double asterisks (**word**) makes that word bold.
You can create lists with hyphens (-) or numbers (1., 2., 3.).
Code can be placed in the middle of a line with single backticks (`code`).
A code block can be created by putting code in between a set of triple backticks (```).
You can insert a link with brackets and parentheses ([Link text here](http://jhu.edu)).
You can use an image with an exclamation point, and a link to an image (![Alt text here](http://jhu.edu/jeff.jpg))
